# RayTracing2D
2D Ray Tracing I made using JavaScript as a challenge for/by @The Coding Train

Might work on a 3D render project using this project or a Neural Network project where the rays work as sensors for self-driving cars.
Or I might just use it for some Lunar-eclipse projection or any kind of artwork.

One can also maybe utilize the project for implementing it as a cool mouse pointer or something else on their web browser or something like that idk.

The pointer or "Ray-cast-er" follows the mouse pointer and the walls/boundaries are randomized.
You can also make the "light-source" move by itself, I have added the code for the same (it has been turned into comments)
